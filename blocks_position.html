    <p>For the purposes of understanding how articles are used, it is important to know that nouns can be either
        count (can be counted) or noncount (indefinite in quantity and cannot be counted). In addition, count nouns are
        either singular (one) or plural (more than one). Noncount nouns are always in singular form.

        For example, if we are speaking of water that has been spilled on the table, there can be one drop (singular) or
        two
        or more drops (plural) of water on the table. The word drop in this example is a count noun because we can count
        the
        number of drops. Therefore, according to the rules applying to count nouns, the word drop would use the articles
        a
        or the.

        However, if we are speaking of water in general spilled on the table, it would not be appropriate to count one
        water
        or two waters -- there would simply be water on the table. Water is a noncount noun. Therefore, according to the
        rules applying to noncount nouns, the word water would use no article or the, but not a.

        Following are the three specific rules which explain the use of definite and indefinite articles.

        Rule #1 - Specific identity not known: Use the indefinite article a or an only with a singular count noun whose
        specific identity is not known to the reader. Use a before nouns that begin with a consonant sound, and use an
        before nouns that begin with a vowel sound.

        Use the article a or an to indicate any non-specified member of a group or category.
        I think an animal is in the garage
        That man is a scoundrel.
        We are looking for an apartment.

        Use the article a or an to indicate one in number (as opposed to more than one).
        I own a cat and two dogs.

        Use the article a before a consonant sound, and use an before a vowel sound.
        a boy, an apple

        ◊ Sometimes an adjective comes between the article and noun:

        an unhappy boy, a red apple

        The plural form of a or an is some. Use some to indicate an unspecified, limited amount (but more than one).
        an apple, some apples

        Rule #2 - Specific identity known: Use the definite article the with any noun (whether singular or plural, count
        or
        noncount) when the specific identity of the noun is known to the reader, as in the following situations:

        Use the article the when a particular noun has already been mentioned previously.
        I ate an apple yesterday. The apple was juicy and delicious.

        Use the article the when an adjective, phrase, or clause describing the noun clarifies or restricts its
        identity.
        The boy sitting next to me raised his hand.
        Thank you for the advice you gave me.

        Use the article the when the noun refers to something or someone that is unique.
        the theory of relativity
        the 2003 federal budget

        Rule #3 - All things or things in general: Use no article with plural count nouns or any noncount nouns used to
        mean
        all or in general.

        Trees are beautiful in the fall. (All trees are beautiful in the fall.)
        He was asking for advice. (He was asking for advice in general.)
        I do not like coffee. (I do not like all coffee in general.)


        Additional Information Regarding the Use of Articles

        When indicating an unspecified, limited amount of a count or noncount noun, use some.
        My cousin was seeking some advice from a counselor (not advice in general or advice about everything, but a
        limited
        amount of advice).

        I would love some coffee right now (not coffee in general, but a limited amount of coffee).

        We might get rain tomorrow. Some rain would be good for the crops (a certain amount of rain, as opposed to rain
        in
        general).

        There are some drops of water on the table (a limited number, but more than one drop).

        Noncount nouns are those which usually cannot be counted. Following are some common examples:

        Geographical names are confusing because some require the and some do not.
        ◊ Use the with: united countries, large regions, deserts, peninsulas, oceans, seas, gulfs, canals, rivers,
        mountain
        ranges, groups of islands

        the United Arab Emirates
        the Sacramento River
        the Aleutians

        ◊ Do not use the with: streets, parks, cities, states, counties, most countries, continents, bays, single lakes,
        single mountains, islands
